# proj4-compare-Baltimore-NewYork-household-income

## Background
This project aims to compare household income in Baltimore (MD) and New York (NY). I choose these two cities because I attend university in Baltimore, and have visited New York most of the time as an international student. While Baltimore and New York are only 3-hours drives away and both are in a Metropolitan area, they are very different. New York's medium income is around $52,737 while Baltimore's median income is $41,819. New York housing costs are 495.4% more expensive than Baltimore housing costs. And New York's population is around 8,000,000 while Baltimore's population is around 620,000. The above data are from [2021 Compare Cities Overview: Baltimore, MD vs New York, NY](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/baltimore_md/new_york_ny/overview).

In particular, I want to dive into the comparison of the household income in Baltimore and New York. Since household income and socioeconomic status (SES) are key factors affecting the economic robustness of a city, I would also like to investigate how household income is affected by the income level of the previous generation. 

The dataset I used for this study is from the [Opportunity Insight Project](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), which is a project with a mission is to identify barriers to economic opportunity and develop scalable solutions that will empower people throughout the United States to rise out of poverty and achieve better life outcomes.
